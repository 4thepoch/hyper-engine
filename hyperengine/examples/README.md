# Examples

1. **Getting Started**
 - [**Hello World**](01_hello_word_with_mnist.py):
 a very simple example to run your existing model in Hyper-Engine environment.
 - [**Getting Started with Tuning**](02_getting_started_with_tuning.py):
 tuning a single parameter (`learning_rate`) to find the best value for
 a simple CNN.
 - [**Saving Best Models**](03_saving_best_models_mnist.py):
 tuning several hyper-parameters and saving the best CNN models on the disk.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
 - [**Exploring CNN architectures to beat MNIST record**](04_cnn_mnist.py):
 exploring and tuning all possible variations of the CNN design to get
 to the top accuracy for the MNIST dataset.
 - [**Exploring CNN architectures for CIFAR-10 dataset](05_cnn_cifar.py):
 exploring different variations of of the CNN design for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
 
   Note: this example needs `tflearn` library for fetching CIFAR-10.
